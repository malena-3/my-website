            <p>Hi, I’m Malena! I’m a Computer Science student who loves using technology to solve real-world problems. As the president of She.Codes, I’m focused on fostering a welcoming community for women in STEM. Outside of tech, I enjoy running or hiking outside, spending quality time with loved ones, and relaxing with a good book.</p>
